# LaserKitty Capstone

I have one roommate – she is a cat. We live in a microapartment; a cramped studio of 209 sq. ft. Attending Ada takes me away from my home, and her, for a minimum of eight hours a day.

To keep her brain stimulated and occupied, I'm going to build her a laser toy she can play with—and I can control in the browser—when I'm not home. It will also help me track her activity and log it for review.

# Product Plan

## Problem Statement

My cat is over-grooming out of boredom. I can't be with her for upwards of eight hours of the day (not including when I'm sleeping). She's a young kitty that need stimulation and activity. There are good laser toys on the market, but they run upwards of $100 and I have the skill set to build my own.
